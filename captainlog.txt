DJANGO 

    contains frontend and backend in the same environment so we have a monolitic thing 
    but what if:

    create a frontend app to serve frontend
    and a backend to work as microservice so we can decople frontend if we do not what it or create a more specialist development

FLASK 
    microservices and a light module, but we need more setups, DJANGO IS NOT ALLOWED, SO WE START WITH THIS thing
    vue
    html
    bootstrap

We must use flask as server side , html/jquery/reactjs for frontend (user interfaces), this because we need a light artefact to better distribution

the use a docker as a development environment is a must to avoid issues in versions/different platforms of developers
